## UI and Styling

- Use Nativewind for styling and components
- Use built-in ui components from gluestack UI such as Button, Input from `@components/ui`
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.
- Make sure to use defined colors and fonts in the tailwind config file.
- Make sure always support dark mode and light mode for styling.
- For the image component use react native and use style props for sizing.
